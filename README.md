# Neural-Network
A Neural Network API created in c++<br />
<br />
<b>RUN THE TEST PROGRAM</b><br />
: cd [project dir]<br />
: mkdir Build<br />
: make<br />
: ./Build/Testing<br />
<br />
<b>DEFAULT TESTING PROGRAM (Testing.cpp)</b><br />
Currently using iris data set hard coded into Core/irisDataSet.h<br />
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set<br />
<br />
Iris data set is very good for testing purposes and trainning the neural network.<br />
Also it helps with testing the program to figure out all of the issues/bugs<br />
